Unlike linear resistance , the resistance of the forward-biased diode is not constant over the entire curve. Because the resistance changes as you move along the VI curve , It is called *dynamic or ac resistance* .$r'_d$

Below the knee of the curve the resistance is greatest because the current increases very little for a given change in voltage ($r'_d = {\triangle V_F}/{\triangle I_F}$). The resistance begins to decrease in the region of knee of the curve and becomes smallest above the knee where there is a large change in current for given change in voltage.
