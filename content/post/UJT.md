- UJT has 2 doped regions with three external leads. It has one emitter and two bases.
- The **emitter** is *heavily* doped having many holes and **n region** is lightly doped. For this reason , the resistance between bases is relatively high typically from $5\hspace{0.2cm}to\hspace{0.2cm}10\hspace{0.1cm}k\Omega$ when emitter is open. This is called **Interbase resitance**, symbolized by $R_{BB}$.

## Intrinsic Standoff ratio


 - (see eq circuit pg 665 fig 21-16)
 
 -    The emitter diode drives the junction of 2 internal resistances, $R_1$ and $R_2$.
  
 -  When the emitter is nonconducting $R_{BB}$ is the sum of $R_{B1}$ and $R_{B2}$.

-  When supply voltage is given between bases as shown in fig 21-16c, The voltage across $R_1$ is given by $$V$$
