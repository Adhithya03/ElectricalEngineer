In a power system network, power is supplied by many generators that are connected in an interconnected network. Instead of using a single large generator, many small DC or AC generators are operated in parallel.

# Why?

### Continuity of Supply

If a single unit of generator is in maintenance or at fault, the entire power plant stops to run load demand.

### Better Efficiency

In power plants, generators are designed to operate on full load and it will get maximum efficiency at full load. Since the power demand is not constant i.e. It fluctuates between *peak* demand during the *day* and *minimum* demand during the *night* period. Hence, it is economical to use a *small generator* during the *night period* and a *large generator* during the *day*.


### Flexibility

The single large generator needed more space. Instead of that, a greater number of generators are installed at different locations.

### Cost-Effective

The cost of electric power is reduced if the generators always operate at full load. When the load demand is high, a greater number of generators are connected in parallel. Hence const effective.

### Easy to Make Additions

Since electricity demand increases day by day. Hence, while constructing a power plant, always keep places for future expansion.

# How?
Some terms before get going, 

**What is bus bar?**

The bus bar is a heavy copper bar and the terminals of the bus bar act as the terminals of an entire power plant.

### Parallel Operation of DC Shunt Generator

![](/EM/ParallelDcGen.png)
Consider this above diagram in this the generator 1 is already connected to the bus bar and it is supplying the load.

Now we need to connect generator 2 with the system.

Let's say we connect -ve terminal of generator to +ve terminal of bus bar since it is DC, a serious short circuit will occur that results in permanent damage in generators.  

So, Before parallel connection

1. Polarity must be checked.
