- Armature winding of a machine is defined as an arrangement of conductors designed to produce emfs by relative motion in conductors in a heteropolar(opposite) magnetic field.

- Electrical machines employ groups of conductors distributed in slots over the peripherey of the armature. The groups of conductors are connected in various types of series-parallel combinations to form armature winding.

- The conductors are connected in series so as to increase voltage rating while they are connected in parallel to increase the current rating.

Some commonly used terms associated with windings

## Conductor
The active length of wire or strip in the slot.

## Turn and Coil
- A **turn** consists of two conductors electrically connected but magnetically separated from each other by a pole pitch or nearly so. 

- The turns are grouped together to form a **coil**. If coil contains only one turn it is called single turn coil while coil more than one turn is called multi-turn coil.
