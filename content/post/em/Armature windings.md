*Armature Winding* is the winding, in which voltage is induced. *Field Winding* is the winding in which the main field flux is produced when the current through the winding is passed. Some of the basic terms related to the Armature Winding are defined as follows:

The conductors are connected in series so as to increase voltage rating while they are connected in parallel to increase the current rating.


# Pole pitch

The *angular* distance between the centers of two adjacent poles on a machine is known as pole pitch or pole span.

## Conductor
The active length of wire or strip in the slot.

## Turn
- A *turn* consists of two conductors electrically connected but magnetically separated from each other by a pole pitch or nearly so. 

## Winding or Coil

- The turns are grouped together to form a *coil*. If coil contains only one turn it is called single turn coil while coil more than one turn is called multi-turn coil.
