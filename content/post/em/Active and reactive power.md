# Active Power

The power which is actually consumed or *utilised* in an AC Circuit is called True power or Active power or Real power.

# Reactive power

The power which flows *back and forth* that means it moves in both the directions in the circuit or reacts upon itself, is called Reactive Power. This reactive power does not perform any useful work in the circuit.

- A *pure inductor* and a *pure capacitor* do not consume any power since in a half cycle whatever power is received from the source by these components, the same power is returned to the source. This power which returns and flows in both the direction in the circuit, is called *Reactive power*.
