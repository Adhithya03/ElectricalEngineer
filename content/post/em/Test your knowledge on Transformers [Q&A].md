1. Why does a transformer have iron core?

Iron core provides an easy (low reluctance) path for the magnetic lines of force.

---

2. Why Sandwiched winding arrangement is preferred in large transformers?

Sandwiched winding provides better magnetic coupling and cooling facilities in large transformers.

3. Explain hysteresis losse in transformer.

### Hystersis loss

The workdone by magnetizing force against internal *friction* of molecules of magnet produce *heat*. This energy which is wasted in the form of heat due to hysteresis is called Hysteresis Loss.

When in the magnetic material, magnetisation force is applied, the molecules of the magnetic material are aligned in one particular direction. And when this magnetic force is reversed in the opposite direction, the internal friction of the molecular magnets opposes the reversal of magnetism resulting in Magnetic Hysteresis.

To wipe out or overcome this internal friction (or in other words, known as residual magnetism), a part of the magnetising force is used. This work, done by the magnetising force produces heat; thereby causing wastage of energy in the form of heat is termed as hysteresis loss.

4. What is an ideal transformer?

An ideal transformer is one which has no ohmic resistance and no magnetic leakage flux.

---
5. Can a transformer work on DC? Justify.

No, a transformer cannot work on DC. If DC is applied there is no rate of change of current meaning only **constant** flux, Which cannot cause mutual induction.

---

6. While drawing phasor diagram of an ideal transformer, the flux vector is drawn 90° out of phase (lagging) to the supply voltage, why?

Under ideal conditions, transformer behaves as a pure inductive circuit; therefore, magnetising current or flux phasor lags behind the voltage phasor by 90°.
