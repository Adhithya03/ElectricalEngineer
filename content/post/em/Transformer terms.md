# Hystersis loss

The workdone by magnetizing force against internal *friction* of molecules of magnet produce *heat*. This energy which is wasted in the form of heat due to hysteresis is called Hysteresis Loss.

When in the magnetic material, magnetisation force is applied, the molecules of the magnetic material are aligned in one particular direction. And when this magnetic force is reversed in the opposite direction, the internal friction of the molecular magnets opposes the reversal of magnetism resulting in Magnetic Hysteresis.

To wipe out or overcome this internal friction (or in other words, known as residual magnetism), a part of the magnetising force is used. This work, done by the magnetising force produces heat; thereby causing wastage of energy in the form of heat is termed as hysteresis loss.
