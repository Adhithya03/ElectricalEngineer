## Flux

-  The magnetic flux $\phi$ (phi) is similar to current in ohm's law formula, It is the total number of lines of force existing in the magnetic circuit. The maxwell is the unit of flux-that is, 1 line of force is equal to maxwell.

## Reluctance

- Reluctance (Similar to resistance in the ohm's law) is the opposition force offered to magnetic flux. The reluctance of a magnetic substance varies directly as the length of the flux path and inversely as the cross-sectional area and the permeablity  $R = \frac{l}{\mu A}$ .


## Magnetomotive force

- The magnetomotive force $F$ comparable to electromotive force in Ohm's law formula is the force that produces flux in magnetic circuits. 

- The practical unit is ampere-turn. Another unit of magnetomotive force sometimes used is the gilbert.

- The gilbert is the magnetomotive force required to establish 1 maxwell of flux in a magnetic circuit having 1 unit of reluctance. The magnetomotive force in gilberts is expressed in terms of ampere-turns as 

$$F = 1.257\hspace{0.1cm}IN$$

where F is in gilberts, I is in amperes, and N is the number of complete turns of wire encircling the circuit.

<!-- - Consider a coil with $N$ turns wound over a core operating at a permeablity $\mu$, when current $I$ amps flows through the coil as shown in the *fig 1.1*. Let mean length of the magnetic path be $l$ meters and the section has area $A\hspace{0.1cm}m^2$.

- Now M.M.F produced by the coil is $I\hspace{0.1cm}N$ amp-turns. This M.M.F is consumed over length $l$ meters to create a flux $\phi$ webers in the core, which operates at permeablity $\mu$.
