# FET

- 3 terminal device. Gate , Source, and Drain.

- Voltage controlled device. Since $I_D$ can be controlled by $V_{GS}$. 

-  Unipolor - It either uses electrons or holes as charge carriers.

- Used for Amplification or  as switch.


## Types FET

1. JFET
	
	1. N-Channel
	
	2. P-Channel  

2. MOSFET
	
	1. D Mosfet 

		1. N-Channel

		2. P-Channel  	

	1. E Mosfet 

		1. N-Channel

		2. P-Channel  	


When compared to BJT 

 -	They have high input impedence.
 
 - More temperature stable.
 
 - Smaller.

- FET are less sensitive to input signal.


# JFET

## Construction of N - JFET.

N bar is sandwidtched between 2 P layers

- We have 2 PN junctions , so 2 depletion region
