Occurs at sufficiently high reverse voltage.
	
- Predominantly occurs above 5.5 volts.

### Theory  

&nbsp;  


- If the $V_{rev}$ is increased it imparts energy to free minority electrons so that as they speed through p-region the collide with atoms with enough energy to knock valence electron into the conduction band , This newly created electron are also high energy and repeat the process.

- The numbers multiply quickly , This effect is called **avalanche effect** and $I_{rev}$ can increase dramatically. Which if not taken care of it will damage the diode.
