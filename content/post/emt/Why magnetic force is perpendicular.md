## Why Magnetic Force Is Perpendicular to velocity ?

- The best answer I can give that would have us look at relativity. When a charge is stationary, everyone around it will see an electric field. But if we're moving past that charge, we'll see a magnetic field. So if some other particle is moving in the field of that charge, it's feeling a magnetic force, while the stationary observer thinks it's moving because of an electric force. This is because electricity and magnetism aren't distinct forces, but are one force which we call electromagnetism. In relativity, they are actually defined by one object, the [Field Tensor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_tensor), from which you can derive Maxwell's Equations, and hence, the Lorentz Force Law.

This [link](http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/rel_el_mag.html) gives you a far more rigorous argument and offers a good example of this in practice with a test charge and a current, and is at a level that you shuold be able to comprehend.

Coming back to your question, and recalling our example, having the magnetic force be at a right angle is the only way that the stationary observer and the moving observer will agree about the direction of the force.
