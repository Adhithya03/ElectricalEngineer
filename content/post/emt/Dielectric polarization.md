## Dielectric intro

- In dielectric, all charges are tightly attached to specific atoms, and all they can do is move within the molecule.  Such microscopic displacements are not as dramatic as the wholesale rearrangement of charge in a conductor, but their cumulative effects account for their characteristic behavior of dielectric.

## Induced dipoles

- Although the atom is electrically neutral, there is a positively charged core (the nucleus) and a negatively charged electron cloud surrounding it. When neutral atom is placed in a electric field, These two regions are influenced by electric field: the *nucleus* is *pushed* in the direction of electric field, and the *electrons* in the opposite way. 
- If the field is large enough it can rip the atom completely, **ionizing** it (the substance then becomes a conductor). With less extreme fields, however, an equilibrium is soon established, for if the center of the electron cloud does not coincide with nucleus. The two opposing forces - **E** pulling the *electrons* and *nucleus* apart, leaving the atom **polarized**.

$\hspace{0.1cm}^{**}$ Dipole moment is measurement of the separation of two opposite electrical charges.

- The atom now has tiny $\hspace{0.1cm}^{**}$*dipole moment* $\large p$ which points in the same direction as the electric field **E**. The induced dipole moment is approximately proportional to the field.(as long as the field is not too strong). 

$$p =\alpha E$$

The proportionality constant $\alpha$ is called atomic polarizability. Which depends on detailed structure of the atom.
