- Operates only under forward bias.

- Energy released in the form of light when free electrons in the conduction band recombines with holes in the valence band. This process is called electroluminesence.

- Wavelength and color of light emitted depends on **Forbidden gap (or) Energy gap** of the materials.

## Working of LED

- Free electrons from N-side and holes from P-side are pushed towards the junction. The recombination of free electrons and holes takes place in depetion region as well as in P-type and n-type semiconductor.

- The free electrons in conduction band releases energy in the form of light before they recombine with holes in the valence band. Since energy of free electrons is always more than energy of valence electrons or holes , So it needs to lose energy in order to recombine with holes. Hence each recombination of charge emits energy in the form of light. 

- The brightness of emitted light depends on the **materials** and **Forward current**.

- In normal silicon diodes , energy gap between valence and conduction band is less , so low energy photos of low frequency are released which are invisible to human eye. Whereas in LED Energy gap is very large so  high energy photos with high freq. are released which are visible to human eye.

- Led can turn off and on at very high speed of 1 ns.
